Consider this page just as my own personal mind dump!
I will probably never build any of the following keyboards.

## Larger key caps

Some users want larger caps even in the ortholinear layout.

## 2U

To see this on the 60%:

Or The 2U Full Size:

## Original keycaps

You can even keep your original keycap set on the full size!
Though the plate would be a little misaligned.

Or you can replace the left keys with 1U replacements and left-align the keyboard.

## Arrows

There are several ways, if you want to add the arrow cluster to 60%:

Or the 75 size with arrows:

Or the navless with arrow keys:

![ortholinear keyboard layout navless complete arrows](images/keyboard-layout-ortholinear-navless-complete-arrows.png)

## Nav keys

We can keep original Ctrl, Alt, Win and Menu keys together with the Space Bar.

![ortholinear keyboard layout 75 complete2](images/keyboard-layout-ortholinear-75-complete2.png)

But this layout repeats several of the nav keys if put on the full size keyboard:

Better to be put on a navless:
